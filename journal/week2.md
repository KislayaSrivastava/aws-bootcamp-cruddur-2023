# Week 2 — Distributed Tracing
This week, i understood the theory and completed hands-on for observability using Rollbar, HoneyComb, Xray and CloudWatch logs. 
I completed my pricing and security quiz.

I also understood the cost considerations of using various tools. 

Out of the 3 questions, I was able to successfully complete two parts and was not able to finish the third part. 

I added a path in my app.py under backend-flask to test for honeycomb.
Then i wrote a function to generate a random number between 1 and 6 and display that on the screen. 
I was facing issues while creating custom attributes. I went through the documentation and found the correct information.

I had added an extra attributed “Version” coded to 2.2.2 which is shown in the result.

I was able to successfully add two attributes and save them. 

Also i was able to create two custom queries and run them.
