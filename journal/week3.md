# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

#### Watched Ashish's Week 3 - Decenteralized Authentication
I began the week by going through Ashish's Amazon Cognito Decentralized Authentication practices video. I understood about AuthZ/AuthN and other methods commonly used (OAuth2/SAML/JWT/OIDC) and their general use-cases. 
I understood the token lifecycle and people lifecycle. 

Later the Cognito service was explained and the importance of best practices to be used by an application and the AWS were highlighted.
