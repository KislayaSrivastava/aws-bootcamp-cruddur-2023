# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

### Creating Postgres Instance 
1) Initial setup of Postgres database was done in week 1 in the docker-compose file. This was once again checked that the database was coming up corrrectly when the application was being started. 

2) Below command was used to create a RDS PostGres database using AWS CLI in Gitpod. My default region is ```ap-south-1``` 

```
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier cruddur-db-instance \
  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version 14.6 \
  --master-username cruddurroot \
  --master-user-password mypassword123 \
  --allocated-storage 20 \
  --availability-zone ap-south-1a \
  --backup-retention-period 0 \
  --port 5432 \
  --no-multi-az \
  --db-name cruddur \
  --storage-type gp2 \
  --publicly-accessible \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --enable-performance-insights \
  --performance-insights-retention-period 7 \
  --no-deletion-protection
```

Post this command execution, i logged into the RDS service on the console and verified that i could see the database. Then to save the cost, i stopped the database temporarily.

3) Andrew asked to comment the dyanamoDB portion of the code in docker-compose.yml file to save the gitpod credits and so i commented that portion out. 

4) General command to connect to a postgres database is as below
   ```  postgresql://[username[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]    ```

   Command to connect to the local database on local host is below
   ```psql -Upostgres --host localhost```
   After this a prompt comes which asks for the password for user postgres. The password is by default ```password```

   Post logging into the database, i created a database named cruddur
   ```CREATE DATABASE CRUDDUR```

   Also learnt different postgresql commands to use while interacting with the database.

   ```
      \x on -- expanded display when looking at data
      \q -- Quit PSQL
      \l -- List all databases
      \c database_name -- Connect to a specific database
      \dt -- List all tables in the current database
      \d table_name -- Describe a specific table
      \du -- List all users and their roles
      \dn -- List all schemas in the current database
      CREATE DATABASE database_name; -- Create a new database
      DROP DATABASE database_name; -- Delete a database
      CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype1, column2 datatype2, ...); -- Create a new table
      DROP TABLE table_name; -- Delete a table
      SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Select data from a table
      INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...); -- Insert data into a table
      UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition; -- Update data in a table
      DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; -- Delete data from a table
   ```

### Setting up Postgres Drivers on backend-flask 

1) 2 folders were created in backend-flask ie bin and db. The bin folder contained the different database bash scripts to connect/disconnect/load schema and load the data. The db folder had the sql files for the schema loading and seeding the actual records.

   In addition two python modules were added to the requirements.txt file and then compiled.
