# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
Apologies for the delay in submitting my work. 
As part of this bootcamp, i did the following as part of my pre-work
a) Setup Github account and MFA, created codespaces, gitpod, lucidchart, honeycomb accounts. 
b) Next i setup the gitpod environment to ensure i could work on my github account directly via gitpod using online code editing. 
c) Next I watched the live stream recorded video for this week where i learnt about the application and had a very good introduction about architecture 
thought process. I also learnt the usage of lucidchart application
d) Then i setup the AWS account and created MFA for my root account. Created my IAM user and generated AWS credentails. I also setup the Billing alarms.
e) Then i created my lucidchart diagrams. I faced issues using grouping the elements together. I tried a few times but i did not get how to group them together.
So for now i have created the diagram but it is not showing the VPC and the cloud region in its entirety.
